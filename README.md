ðŸ‘‹ Hello everyone! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Benjamin Stilphen, I am a junior studying computer science at the University of Connecticut.

During my time here at UCONN I have been developing my skills as a programmer through courses such as systems programming, algorithms and complexity, and data structures and algorithms to name a few. 

All of which have helped me in my goal of one day becoming a great software engineer.

I am currently seeking out a summer internship for 2022.

ðŸ“« The best way to contact me would be by email at: benstilphen@gmail.com

Thanks for reading!
